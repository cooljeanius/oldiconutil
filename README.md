`oldiconutil`
===========

A tool to postprocess `iconutil`-generated .icns files to make them compatible with Mac OS X 10.5.

Syntax
------

    	oldiconutil [--inplace] <icnsFilePath>

Takes the given .icns file and creates a new icon that displays correctly on Mac OS X 10.5 next to it. 
E.g. give it AndysNewIcon.icns and it creates a file AndysNewIcon\_10\_5.icns in the same directory.

If you pass the `--inplace` option, it will replace the given file with the converted file instead of creating a new, renamed icon file.

Background
----------

In Mac OS X 10.6, Apple introduced support for PNG-compressed icon data in .icns files. 
In Mac OS X 10.8, Apple introduced support for Retina icons and the `iconutil` command-line tool for generating icons from a folder of PNG files.

However, `iconutil` only knows how to generate PNG-compressed icon data, which means that you can't use it to create a Retina icon that will still display properly on Mac OS X 10.5.

Solution
--------

`oldiconutil` post-processes any .icns files you give it, extracts the PNG data and re-compresses it using JPEG 2000. If you give it an icon generated by
`iconutil`, you can create a Retina icon that displays correctly and beautifully on Mac OS X 10.8 all the way back through Mac OS X 10.5.
